# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
The each method would be useful when you need to loop through the elements of an array. So you are looking to do something with each individual element. And want the computer to cycle through instead of doing them individually. 
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
I personally still need practice with when to use puts or if statment, spent a good moment scratching my head on which is needed. More practice with it and I'll be golden
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?
Running notes doc - once I figured out how to do something it went straight into my notes which allowed me to make easy reference when going to the challenge.
